#### Visualizing Ride-Hailing Insights for Business Strategy
## Project Overview
This Power BI project dives into ride-hailing data using UberTrip datasets to uncover key trends in bookings, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

I built a dynamic, multi page dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore performance metrics across locations, vehicles, payment methods, and time all driven by an efficient data model and interactive visuals.

This project reflects what I do best: turn messy datasets into clear, visual, business-relevant stories.

## What This Dashboard Solves
Whatâ€™s the overall performance of Uber trips?

How do trip patterns vary by time of day and day of the week?

What payment types and vehicle types are preferred by riders?

Which cities and locations drive the most activity?

## Tools Used
- Power BI	Dashboard creation and data modeling
- Power Query	Data cleaning and transformation
- DAX	Calculated columns, measures, and KPI logic
- Excel	Initial cleaning and validation
- GitHub	Project showcase and documentation

## Data Model
UberTrip Table and Location Table joined via Location ID

Built a Calendar Table using DAX for time-based slicing

Implemented 1-to-many relationships for optimized visuals and filters

Follows a Star Schema structure for clean performance
